<p> It has been over a month since I last wrote something in my blog. I've been a bit busy the last
few days. I just went through my midterms in all of my classes, and also had my midterm presentation for
my thesis. Thesis has proven to be very stressful and challenging. After the midterm  <!--excerpt--> presentation, my thesis partner
and I have become increasingly worried on how we are going to develop the whole platform. People tell me this is just how thesis
is suppose to be like, and everything will turn out fine. I hope they're right. </p>

<p> In my other classes, I don't think I am struggling hard in any particular subject. As for my freelance
stint as a developer, I have done some small part time work to earn a little buck, and now I
am working for a project to make another website for a group of Ateneo students. I like doing these small part time projects because
it forces me to learn new things because I need to deliver and satisfy my client. I was also accepted to be a deputy in OSE (Office of Student
Exchange) in ASEC (Ateneo Student Exchange Council). I am tasked to manage their website, but so far I have not done anything spectacular,
other than meeting with people in the org. They are great people! :D Also, I am still technically an intern at Tralulu,
a travel website that conncects local guides and tourists. Although I have been inactive, I just made a pull request of my changes
in their platform. Overall though, my status in their company has become kind of complicated. </p>

<p> I am currently in my fifth year in Ateneo and a lot of my friends in college that I spent most of my
time with in school are now either in medschool or lawschool or currently working. I can't deny that I miss
my old buddies and I'm sure my last year in Ateneo would be more fun with them around. But I guess this is
just how life is. Life goes on and we all need to keep moving forward. </p>

<p> Cheers! </p>
