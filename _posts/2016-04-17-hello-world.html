<p> Hello World! </p>

<p> Finally! I'm done configuring everything. Setting this site up took a while since I am
still working my way on blogging in Jekyll. I think I am starting to figure out how
everything works, but I'm sure I have a long way until I totally understand everything.
Thankfully, Jekyll's  <!--excerpt--> documentation is easy enough to understand and there are
plenty of resources online. :D
</p>
<p> I've always wanted to start a blog way back, but then life always seems to get in the way. I came
across this <a href="http://www.themacro.com/articles/2016/05/why-the-best-give-away/"> article </a>
that pushed me to start writing. (You should read it too.) I guess you can say that it was inspiration
that prompted me to start my blog. I just hope this inspiration doesn't go away anytime soon lol.
Also because of my newfound determination, I also bought my first domain today. Funny story when I bought
this domain, my credit card got charged twice. I had to talk with their customer service to ask for a
refund. Haha </p>

<p> So what's the purpose of this blog? Well, to document my life of course. I hope I can write just
about everything that matters to me. I am also planning to blog about all
my entreprenurial journeys and write about software and code. Time to share my knowledge to the world. Haha
Since I also easily forget a lot of things, this blog can also serve as my online notes.
I hope I can update this blog continuously! </p>

<p>Cheers! </br></br> </p>
