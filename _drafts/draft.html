Hello!

It has been well over a month since I last wrote something in my blog. I've been a bit busy the last few days.
I just went through my midterms in all of my classes, and also had my midterm presentation for my thesis. Thesis has proven to be very
stressful. After the midterm presentation, my thesis partner and I have become increasingly worried on how we are going to develop the
whole platform. I am hopeful, but at the same time feeling discouraged. People tell me this is just how thesis is suppose to be like,
and everything will turn out fine. I hope they're right.

Anyway, moving on. In school, my classes have been going well and I don't think I am struggling hard in any particular
subject. As for my freelance stint as a developer, I have done some small part time work to earn a little buck, and now I
am working for a project to make another website for a group of Ateneo students. I like doing these small part time projects because
it forces me to learn new things because I need to deliver and satisfy my client. I was also accepted to be a deputy in OSE (Office of Student
Exchange) in ASEC (Ateneo Student Exchange Council). I am tasked to manage their website, but so far I have not done anything spectacular,
other than meeting with people in the org. They are great people! :D Also, I am still technically an intern at Tralulu,
a travel website that conncects local guides and tourists. Although I have been inactive, I just made a pull request of my changes
in their platform. Overall though, my status in their company has become kind of complicated.

I am currently in my fifth year in Ateneo and a lot of my friends in college that I spent most of my time with in school are now either in
medschool/lawschool or currently working. I can't deny that I miss my old pals and I'm sure my last year in Ateneo would be more fun with them around.
But I guess this is just how life is. Life goes on and we all need to keep moving forward.

Cheers!
